<p>Hey love, I'm Miah!</p>

<p>I am a Journalism major at the University of Maryland who specializes in event coverage.</p>

<p>I currently freelance for the Montgomery County Sentinel, with stories that usually cover Montgomery County Board of Education meetings or community events.</p>

<p>I'm also currently a Peer Research Mentor for The First-Year Innovation & Research Experience program, specifically within the Music and Social Identity stream. Before I became a Peer Research Mentor, I had co-authored a research publication that focused on the injustices Black female performers faced in the 1970s. The sections that I solely wrote are "The Over-sexualization of Black Women in the Music Industry," "Approach 1: Disco Artists," and the introduction and Nina Simone sections in "Approach 3: Soul Artists." Eventually, I had the opportunity to become an IRIE Research Fellow for MSI, a difficult position to acquire as only one can be chosen to advise students in their summer program.</p> 

<p>I was also a Logistics and Guest Experience intern at G.L.O.WIN Lifestyle. During my time, I helped the company prepare for its 2025 conference, which consisted of creating registration forms, room decoration, and marketing to promote the event. I also co-designed the event registration page.</p>

<p>I was also an Academic Peer Mentor for students taking elementary statistics at the University of Maryland. I guided them through statistical problems by co-hosting study sessions and independently answering questions by email. Through my time as an AMP, I was able to motivate students and further develop my analytical skills.</p>

<p>I also interned at Holy Cross Hospital. I assisted nurses and doctors with caring for patients. My tasks varied from restocking utilities to welcoming visitors and guiding them to patient rooms. My time at Holy Cross helped me to easily talk with people, a skill that comes in handy when doing interviews.</p>

<p>I was a staff writer for Paint Branch High's newspaper, MAINSTREAM. I interviewed the school principal and mainly wrote opinion articles.</p>

<p>When I'm not busy with school, I spend time with my family, pets, or friends. I love reading books and catching up on missed sleep.</p>
