<!-- HERE IS WHERE THE STORY WILL START -->
<p>Greek-letter organizations promise leadership, community and lifelong bonds, yet it can also attract the most troubling stories on college campuses.</p>
<!-- ATTACHED LINK TO TEXT FOR SUPPORT/EVIDENCE -->
<p>A <a href="https://today.umd.edu/briefs/umd-suspends-new-member-social-events-at-37-fraternities-and-sororities" target="blank">cease and desist order</a> was issued by the University of Maryland, suspending all social and recruitment activities of all its Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Association institutions on March 1, 2024. The cause for the order was a result of reports of serious misconduct threatening “the safety and well-being of members of the University community.”</p> 
<!-- ATTACHED LINK TO TEXT FOR SUPPORT/EVIDENCE -->
<p>One <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/maryland/mddce/8:2024cv00992/557081/33/" target="blank">anonymous email</a> was sent to the University’s Office of Student Conduct that said new members of unidentified fraternities were being beaten with a paddle, burned by cigarettes, forced to consume urine and much more. Another anonymous report was from a parent who claimed their son had to go to urgent care for possible hypothermia and exhaustion after being forced outside for several hours by the fraternity.</p>

<p>The order barred 37 IFC and PHA chapters from contacting new members and hosting alcohol-related social events. The ban was <a href="https://today.umd.edu/briefs/umd-lifts-suspension-of-new-member-alcohol-related-activities-for-32-fraternities-sororities" target="blank">lifted</a> two weeks later, and Kappa Alpha Theta filed a <a href="https://www.kappaalphatheta.org/blog/fraternity/kappa-alpha-theta-files-suit-against-the-university-of-maryland" target="blank">lawsuit</a> on April 4, 2024.</p>

  <p><strong>“It’s imperative that we stand together to protect students’ rights and wellbeing and discourage this broad action from happening at other campuses,” Kappa Alpha Theta said in a statement on April 5, 2024.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>In the lawsuit, Kappa Alpha Theta and six individuals claimed the university violated their constitutional rights, specifically denying students their right to freedom of speech. The suit also argued that the cease and desist suppressed the sorority’s ability to express and organize publicly.</p> 

<p>During the ban, a consulting firm hired by the university carried out more than 150 interviews with sorority and fraternity members. Kappa Alpha Theta, in its lawsuit, alleged the interviews were interrogations and students’ cell phones were searched. Additionally, the sorority said that some students weren’t allowed an attorney and would face disciplinary action if they didn’t comply with the university.</p> 

<p>Eventually, the court dismissed the lawsuit since the cease and desist was lifted before it was filed, stating “federal courts have no power to hear moot cases.”</p>

<p>Currently, UMD will begin including <a href="https://belonging.umd.edu/news-from-around-campus/umd-to-track-hazing-incidents-in-campus-security-reports-the-diamondback" target="blank">hazing incidents in security reports</a> starting in 2026, as announced in an email on Sept. 5. This is a result of the U.S. federal law, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5646" target="blank">Stop Campus Hazing Act</a>, that was enacted on Dec. 23, 2024. The act requires colleges and universities that participate in federal student aid programs to report hazing incidents. Further, higher institutions must release findings concerning any student organization found to violate standards of conduct relating to hazing.</p>

<p>Although fraternities and sorority organizations at UMD have faced scrutiny, students continue to seek out Greek life.</p>

<blockquote class="pull-quote">
<p><strong>“As someone who came into college with little knowledge about what clubs and activities were out there, I would say that Greek life was the most ideal outlet for me to get to know other people the quickest and in the most enjoyable way,” said Gabriela “Gabby” Friedman.</strong></p>
</blockquote> 
<br>
<p>Friedman joined Greek life in 2023, becoming a member of Alpha Delta Phi. The 20-year-old served as an officer of her chapter and said she had familial Greek life connections, which made the process easier to navigate. She said she found that Greek life provided her with long-lasting connections and bettered her professional life.</p> 

<p>Despite her noting the experience as valuable, Friedman said that Greek life can have problematic moments depending on the chapter and its members' behaviors. Members need to be consciously aware of their actions, as they can get everyone within the organization in trouble.</p> 
<br>
<!-- PUTTING A PULL QUOTE HERE -->
<blockquote class="pull-quote">
<p><strong>“Problematic aspects occur from foolish choices that can be ordinarily made by anyone,” Friedman said. “But carry a heavier burden since you are now part of a larger organization than just yourself, therefore there are heavier consequences to bear.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>Victor Tan, a computer science major at UMD, doesn’t participate in Greek life but knows friends who do. He said his friends are only involved to enhance their professional careers, and not to participate in the “stereotypical party frat.” Tan also said that when you’re engaged in it, you make connections that can be beneficial in the future.</p> 

<p>Those connections are what Tan said he feels many people, when they come to college, want to have to get a full college experience. He said he understands the incentives sororities and fraternities offer and how helpful it is for professional opportunities. However, he said he wouldn’t join a fraternity due to time commitments.</p> 
<br>

<blockquote class="pull-quote">
<p><strong>“One of the negatives about Greek life is dedicating a lot of time,” Tan said. “You have to prove yourself and keep up with events while maintaining social connections, which causes people to take a lot of pressure that they at first didn’t agree to until they’re fully immersed in it.”</strong></p>
